# SDE-III Expectations & Preparation Strategy

An SDE-III engineer is expected to:

- Design scalable backend systems
- Own services end-to-end
- Make architecture decisions
- Handle failures and trade-offs
- Mentor junior engineers

---

## Preparation Strategy

- Build fewer projects, but build them deeply
- Focus on system design and scalability
- Always justify architectural choices
- Think in terms of failures, not happy paths
